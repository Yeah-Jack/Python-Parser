# Text Parser

This project contains a Python script that reads a text file, splits the text into sentences, formats the sentences, and writes the formatted text to a new file.

## File Structure

- `Parser.py`: The main script that performs the text parsing and formatting.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place the text file you want to parse in the same directory as `Parser.py` and name it `input.txt`.
3. Run the `Parser.py` script with Python:

```python
python Parser.py
```
